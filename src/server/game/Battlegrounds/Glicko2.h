 * - Rating (r): The player's skill level (default 1500, higher is better)
 * - Rating Deviation (RD): Uncertainty about the rating (decreases with more games)
 * - Volatility (σ): Expected fluctuation in performance (measures consistency)

/**
 * @class Glicko2System
 * @brief Implements the Glicko-2 rating algorithm for skill-based matchmaking
 * 
 * The Glicko-2 system is an improvement over the Elo rating system, adding:
 * - Rating Deviation (RD) to measure uncertainty
 * - Volatility to measure consistency
 * - Better handling of inactive players
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * @code
 * Glicko2System system(0.5f); // tau = 0.5
 * Glicko2Rating playerRating(1500.0f, 200.0f, 0.06f);
 * 
 * std::vector<Glicko2Opponent> opponents;
 * opponents.emplace_back(1400.0f, 30.0f, 1.0f);  // Beat a 1400-rated opponent
 * opponents.emplace_back(1550.0f, 100.0f, 0.0f); // Lost to a 1550-rated opponent
 * 
 * Glicko2Rating newRating = system.UpdateRating(playerRating, opponents);
 * @endcode
